I'm a technology industry veteran with a pattern of joining early-stage companies and helping them scale to massive success. Here's my story and what drives me.<!--more-->

## Career Timeline

### Nutanix (2011-2020)

## Professional Strengths

### 1. Early-Stage Pattern Recognition
- Demonstrated ability to identify transformative technologies before mainstream adoption
- Track record of joining companies that become category leaders

### 2. Technical Evangelism
- Known for translating complex technical concepts into understandable content
- Created industry-defining technical documentation (Nutanix Bible)
- Strong ability to communicate value propositions to technical and business audiences

### 3. Go-to-Market Expertise
- Experience taking enterprise products from zero to scale
- Understanding of both technical and commercial aspects of enterprise sales

### 4. Founder Intuition
- Has a "gut feeling" for recognizing exceptional founding teams
- Values learning opportunity regardless of outcome

## The "Dheeraj Moment"

I've experienced a recurring pattern when meeting exceptional founders:

> "My first conversation with Dheeraj Pandey in 2011 convinced me to join Nutanix. I knew that even if we failed, I would learn a ton from working with someone of his caliber."

This same intuition struck again when meeting Ema's founders:

> "Talking to Surojit and Souvik reminded me of that first conversation with Dheeraj. I got the same feeling - these are people I want to learn from, regardless of outcome."

## Fun Facts

- I have a pattern of joining companies before they become billion-dollar success stories
- I'm known for my ability to simplify complex technical concepts
- I value founder quality and learning opportunity over "safe" career choices
- I've been part of multiple infrastructure/platform shifts (virtualization → cloud → AI)

## What I Believe

**On career decisions:**
> "The best career moves aren't always the safest ones. They're the ones where you find founders you want to learn from and technology you believe will change the world."

**On technology shifts:**
> "Every major platform shift creates a window of opportunity. The question isn't whether to jump—it's whether you've found the right team to jump with."

**On learning:**
> "I'd rather work with exceptional people on something that might fail than play it safe with average teams on sure things. The learning is incomparable."
