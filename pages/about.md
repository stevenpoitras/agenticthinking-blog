Hey there! I'm Steven Poitras, a technology industry veteran with a track record of joining early-stage companies and helping them scale to massive success. I'm currently at [Ema](https://ema.co), where I'm focused on building the future of enterprise AI through agentic AI employees.

Before Ema, I spent nearly a decade at [Nutanix](https://nutanix.com) where I was part of the journey from scrappy startup to $5B+ public company. I created the "Nutanix Bible"—an industry-defining technical resource that became the go-to guide for hyperconverged infrastructure. I then joined [DevRev](https://devrev.ai) to continue working with visionary founders on next-generation developer and customer relationship tools.

I write about agentic AI, enterprise transformation, and the patterns I've observed across multiple platform shifts. This site is my space to think out loud about where technology is headed and what it means for how we work.

Thanks for stopping by. <!--tomb-->
